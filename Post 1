<p>With the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson ruling this summer, individual states have been granted increased power to restrict or ban abortions. One result of these strict abortion laws is that pharmacists have reportedly delayed or refused to fill common medications used to treat a variety of chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis over concerns that the medications could end a pregnancy.</p>

<p>One drug that has been at the center of some of these stories is the drug mexthotrexate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Methotrexate is prescribed to about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.arthritis.org/drug-guide/medication-topics/understanding-methotrexate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90% of people with rheumatoid arthritis</a>&nbsp;at some point in their treatment, reports the non-profit patient organization Arthritis Foundation.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the Dobbs decision, the Arthritis Foundation&nbsp;<a href="https://www.arthritis.org/about-us/news-and-updates/new-barrier-to-methotrexate-for-arthritis-patients" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued a statement</a>&nbsp;warning of potential medication disruptions and&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=yYqHBXqATUeCmRZHYuhsKsER3A34SK9Dqj8GOyCoa8tUMUhTR1dTNU5CQk9XMVFSOU9EWllBVFRNQy4u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened a survey</a>&nbsp;to learn about community members’ experiences and said multiple people reported issues accessing medication.</p>

<p>This month, a news outlet in Tucson, Arizona,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kold.com/2022/10/01/teen-girl-denied-medication-refill-under-azs-new-abortion-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;that a teenage girl had been denied a refill on prescription medication due to concerns that it could induce an abortion of a hypothetical pregnancy.</p>

<p>Fourteen-year-old Emma Thompson has been taking methotrexate for years to manage rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune condition that can cause widespread inflammation and debilitating joint damage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But when her mother visited a local Walgreens to pick up this month’s refill of the drug, the pharmacist initially declined to provide it. Although the pharmacy eventually filled the prescription, Thompson’s mother worries about the potential for future medication disruptions in a state where abortion-inducing drugs are restricted.</p>

<p>“I did end up leaving with the medication that day, but I don’t know if it’s going to be filled next month,” she told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/mom-speaks-14-year-daughter-denied-arthritis-medication-91107896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Morning America</a>. “I don’t know what the future holds right now, and not only for my daughter, but for every little girl that needs this medication.”</p>
